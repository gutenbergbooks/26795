<h1><big>GET OUT OF OUR SKIES!</big></h1>

<h2>By E. K. JARVIS</h2>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">On the</span> first cloudy day in
November, Tom Blacker,
the shining light of Ostreich
and Company, Public Relations
Counsellors, placed a
call to a shirtsleeved man on
the rooftop of the Cannon
Building in New York City.</p>

<p>His message brought an
immediate response from the
waiting engineer, who flicked
switches and twirled dials
with expert motions, and
brought into play the gigantic
50,000-watt projector installed
on the peak.</p>

<p>In his own office, Tom
paced the floor in front of
the three-window exposure,
watching the heavens for the
results.</p>

<p>They weren't long in coming.</p>

<p>The eyes came first. Eyes
the size of Navy dirigibles,
with pupils of deep cerulean
blue, floating against the
backdrop of the gray cumulus.
The long lashes curled out almost
a hundred feet from the
lids. Then the rest of Monica
Mitchell's famous face appeared:
the flowing yellow
locks, the sensuously curved
lips, parted moistly from even
white teeth. From chin to
hairline, the projected image
above the city was close to a
thousand feet in diameter.</p>

<p>Then, as if the floating
countenance wasn't alarming
enough, the ruby lips began
to move. Monica's sweet-sultry
voice, like the first
drippings from a jar of
honey, overcame the city
sounds, and began crooning
the syrupy strains of <i>Love Me
Alone</i>. Which happened, by no
coincidence, to be the title and
theme song of Monica's newest
epic.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/001.png" width="360" height="550" alt="" title="" />
<small><b>Monica's image&mdash;plastered across the heavens&mdash;stopped<br />
traffic in all directions.</b></small></div>

<p>It was a triumph. Tom
knew it the moment he looked
down at the crowded
thoroughfare eighteen stories
beneath the window. Traffic
had come to a more than normal
standstill. Drivers were
leaving their autos, and hands
were being upraised towards
the gargantuan face on the
clouds above.</p>

<p>And of course, Tom's phone
rang.</p>

<hr />

<p>Ostreich's big scowling face
was barely squeezed within
the confines of the visiphone
screen. He said nothing intelligible
for two minutes.</p>

<p>"Relax, Chief," Tom said
brightly. "I've been saving
this as a surprise."</p>

<p>Ostreich's reply was censorable.</p>

<p>"Now look, D. O. You gave
me <i>carte blanche</i> with this
Mitchell babe, remember? I
figured we really needed a shot
in the arm for this new picture
of hers. The receipts on
her last turkey couldn't pay
her masseurs."</p>

<p>Ostreich, who had built his
firm by establishing golden
public images for various industrialists
and their enterprises,
had anticipated trouble
the moment he let the barrier
down to admit such unworthy
clients as Monica Mitchell.
But he had never anticipated
that his ace publicist would
display such carnival tactics
in their promotion. He growled
like a taunted leopard.</p>

<p>"This is a cheap trick,
Tom! Do you hear me? Turn
that thing off at once!"</p>

<p>"Who, me?" Tom said innocently.
"Gosh, D. O. I'm no
engineer. I left instructions
with the operator to keep the
projector going for three
hours, until sunset. Don't
think I can do anything about
it now."</p>

<p>"You'll damn well <i>have</i> to
do something about it! You're
ruining us!"</p>

<p>"Look at it this way, Chief.
What can we lose? If anybody
takes offense, we can blame it
on that Hollywood gang."</p>

<p>"Turn that damn thing off!
If that blankety face isn't out
of the sky in ten minutes, you
can start emptying your
desk!"</p>

<p>Tom was a redhead. He
reached over and snapped the
visiphone switch before his
boss could have the satisfaction.
He stomped to the window,
still raging at Ostreich's
lack of appreciation.</p>

<p>But he chuckled when he
saw the activity in the street.
The crowds were thickening
at the intersections, and a
special battalion of city police
were trying to keep things
moving. Behind him, the visiphone
was beeping frantically
again.</p>

<p>He waited a full minute before
answering, all set to
snap at Ostreich once more.</p>

<p>But it wasn't Ostreich. It
was a square-faced man with
beetling brows and a chin like
the biting end of a steam
shovel. It took Tom a while to
recognize the face of Stinson,
commissioner of police.</p>

<p>"Mr. Blacker?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?" Tom gulped.</p>

<p>"Mr. Ostreich referred me
to you. You responsible for
that&mdash;" the commissioner's
voice was choked. "&mdash;that
menace?"</p>

<p>"Menace, sir?"</p>

<p>"You know what I'm talking
about. We've got half a
dozen CAA complaints already.
That thing's a menace
to public safety, a hazard to
air travel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look, Mr. Stinson. It's
only a harmless publicity
stunt."</p>

<p>"Harmless? You got funny
ideas, Mr. Blacker. Don't get
the wrong idea about our city
ordinances. We got statutes
that cover this kind of thing.
If you don't want to be a victim
of one of them, turn that
damned monstrosity off!"</p>

<p>The commissioner's angry
visage left a reverse shadow
burned on the visiphone
screen. It remained glowing
there long after the contact
was broken.</p>

<p>Tom Blacker walked the
carpeted floor of his office,
chewing on his lower lip, and
cursing the feeble imaginations
of Ostreich and the rest
of them. When his temper had
cooled, he got sober thoughts
of indictments, and law suits,
and unemployment. With a
sigh, he contacted the engineer
on the roof of the Cannon
Building. Then he went
to the window, and watched
Monica's thousand-foot face
fade gradually out of sight.</p>

<hr />

<p>At four o'clock that afternoon,
a long white envelope
crossed Tom's blotter. There
was a check to the amount of
a month's salary enclosed,
and a briefly-worded message
from the office of the president.</p>

<p>When he left the office,
Ostreich's rolling phrases
buzzed in his head like swarming
gnats. "... a mockery of
a great profession ... lowering
of dignity ... incompatible
with the highest ideals
of ..."</p>

<p>At ten o'clock that night,
Tom was telling his troubles
to a red-coated man behind a
chromium bar on Forty-ninth
Street. The man listened with
all the gravity of a physician,
and lined up the appropriate
medicine in front of his patient.</p>

<p>By midnight, Tom was singing
Christmas carols, in advance
of the season, with a
tableful of Texans.</p>

<p>At one o'clock, he swung a
right cross at a mounted policeman,
missed, and fell beneath
the horse's legs.</p>

<p>At one-fifteen, he fell
asleep against the shoulder of
a B-girl as they rode through
the streets of the city in a
sleek police vehicle.</p>

<p>That was all Tom Blacker
remembered, until he woke up
in Livia Cord's cozy two-room
apartment. He moved his head
and winced with the pain.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Hi," the girl said.</p>

<p>She was smiling down at
him, and for a moment, her
floating face reminded Tom
of the episode which had just
cost him twenty grand a year.
He groaned, and rolled the
other way on the contour
couch.</p>

<p>"Hair of the dog?" she said.
There was a gleaming cannister
in her hand.</p>

<p>"No, thanks." He sat up,
rubbing the stiff red hair on
the back of his head. One eye
seemed permanently screwed
shut, but the other managed
to take in his surroundings. It
explored the girl first, and
appreciatively.</p>

<p>She was wearing something
black and satiny, cut in the
newest Dallas-approved style,
with long, tantalizing diagonal
slashes across the breast
and hips. Her hair was strikingly
two-toned, black and
blonde. Her teeth were a
blinding white, and had been
filed to canine sharpness.</p>

<p>"My name's Livia," the girl
said pleasantly. "Livia Cord.
I hope you don't mind what I
did."</p>

<p>"And what was that?"
Tom's other eye popped open,
almost audibly.</p>

<p>"Bailing you out of jail.
Seems you got into a fracas
with a mounted cop. I think
you tried to punch his horse."</p>

<p>"Nuts. I was trying to hit
him."</p>

<p>"Well, you didn't." She
chuckled, and poured herself
a drink. "You've had quite a
day, Mr. Blacker."</p>

<p>"You said it." There was a
taste in his mouth like cigar
ashes. He tried to stand up,
but the weight on his head
kept him where he was. "You
wouldn't have an oxygen pill
around?"</p>

<p>"Sure." She left with a toss
of her skirt and a revelation
of silky calves. When she returned
with the tablet and
water, he took it gratefully.
After a few minutes, he felt
better enough to ask:</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Why'd you bail me out? I
don't know you. Or do I?"</p>

<p>She laughed. "No. Not yet
you don't. But I know you,
Mr. Blacker. By reputation, at
any rate. You see&mdash;" She sat
next to him on the couch, and
Tom was feeling well enough
to tingle at her nearness.
"We're in the same line of
work, you and I."</p>

<p>"Unemployment?"</p>

<p>"No," she smiled. "Public
relations. Only I'm on the
client's side of the fence. I
work for an organization
called Homelovers, Incorporated.
Ever hear of them?"</p>

<p>Tom shook his head.</p>

<p>"Maybe you should. It's a
rather important company,
and growing. And they're always
on the lookout for superior
talent."</p>

<hr />

<p>He squinted at her. "What
is this? A job offer?"</p>

<p>"Maybe." She wriggled a
little, and the slits in her dress
widened just a fraction.
"We've got the nucleus of a
good PR department now.
But with a really experienced
man at the controls&mdash;it could
grow enormously. Think you
might be interested?"</p>

<p>"Maybe I would," Tom said.
But he wasn't thinking about
PR right then.</p>

<p>"Mr. Andrusco's had you in
mind for a long time," Livia
Cord continued. "I've mentioned
your name to him several
times as a possible candidate.
If you hadn't been
fired from Ostreich, we might
have tried to tempt you
away." Her fingers touched a
stray lock of red hair. "Now&mdash;we
don't have to be surreptitious
about it. Do we?"</p>

<p>"No," Tom said guardedly.
"I guess not."</p>

<p>"If you're free tomorrow, I
could arrange a meeting with
Mr. Andrusco. Would you
like that?"</p>

<p>"Well ..."</p>

<p>"His office opens at nine.
We could get there early."</p>

<p>Tom looked at his watch.
Livia said: "I know it's late.
But we could get an early
start in the morning, right
after breakfast. Couldn't
we?"</p>

<p>"I dunno," Tom frowned.
"By the time I get home ..."</p>

<p>"Home?" The girl leaned
back. "Who said anything
about home?"</p>

<p>Her bedroom was monochromed.
Even the sheets
were pink. At five o'clock, the
false dawn glimmered through
the window, and the light falling
on his eyes awakened him.
He looked over at the sleeping
girl, feeling drugged and detached.
She moaned slightly,
and turned her face towards
him. He blinked at the sight
of it, and cried aloud.</p>

<p>"What is it?" She sat up in
bed and nicked on the table
lamp. "What's the matter?"</p>

<p>He looked at her carefully.
She was beautiful. There
wasn't even a smudge of lipstick
on her face.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said dreamily,
and turned away. By the
time he was asleep again, his
mind had already erased the
strange image from his
clouded brain&mdash;that Livia
Cord had absolutely no mouth
at all.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was hard to keep track
of the glass-and-steel structures
that had been springing
up daily along the Fifth-Madison
Thruway. When Tom
and Livia stepped out of the
cab in front of 320, he wasn't
surprised that the building&mdash;an
odd, cylindrical affair with
a pointed spire&mdash;was strange
to him. But he was taken
aback to realize that all sixty
floors were the property of
Homelovers, Incorporated.</p>

<p>"Quite a place," he told the
girl.</p>

<p>She smiled at him tightly.
Livia was crackling with
business electricity this morning,
her spiked heels clicking
along the marble floors of the
lobby like typewriter keys.
She wore a tailored gray suit
that clung to her body with
all the perfection and sexlessness
of a window mannikin.
In the elevator, shooting towards
the executive offices on
the 57th floor, Tom looked
over at her and scratched his
poorly-shaven cheeks in wonderment.</p>

<p>They plowed right through
the frosty receptionist barrier,
and entered an office only
half the size of Penn Station.
The man behind the U-shaped
desk couldn't have been better
suited to the surroundings
by Central Casting. He was
cleft-jawed, tanned, exquisitely
tailored. If his polished
brown toupee had been better
fitted, he would have been
positively handsome.</p>

<p>The handshake was firm.</p>

<p>"Good to see you," he
grinned. "Heard a lot about
you, Mr. Blacker. All of it
good."</p>

<p>"Well," Livia said airily.
"I've done my part. Now you
two come to terms. Buzz me
if you need me, J. A."</p>

<p>John Andrusco unwrapped
a cigar when she left, and
said: "Well, now. Suppose we
get right down to cases, Mr.
Blacker. Our organization is
badly in need of a public relations
set-up that can pull out
all the stops. We have money
and we have influence. Now
all we need is guidance. If
you can supply that, there's a
vacant chair at the end of the
hall that can accommodate
your backside." He grinned
manfully.</p>

<p>"Well," Tom said delicately.
"My big problem is this, Mr.
Andrusco. I don't know what
the hell business you're in."</p>

<p>The executive laughed
heartily. "Then let me fill you
in."</p>

<p>He stepped over to a cork-lined
wall, pressed a concealed
button, and panels parted.
An organizational chart, with
designations that were meaningless
to Tom, appeared behind
it.</p>

<p>"Speaking basically," Andrusco
said, "Homelovers,
Incorporated represents the
interests of the world's leading
real estate concerns. Land,
you know, is still the number
one commodity of Earth, the
one priceless possession that
rarely deteriorates in value.
In fact, with the increase in
the Earth's population, the
one commodity that never
seems to be in excess supply."</p>

<p>"I see," Tom said, not
wholly in truth.</p>

<p>"The stability of real
estate is our prime concern.
By unification of our efforts,
we have maintained these
values over a good many
years. But as you know, a
good business organization
never rests on its laurels.
Sometimes, even basic human
needs undergo unusual&mdash;alterations."</p>

<p>"I'm not following too
well," Tom said frankly. "Just
where does public relations
come into this? I can't see
much connection."</p>

<hr />

<p>Andrusco frowned, but
without wrinkling his serene
brow too much. He went to
the multipaned window and
locked his hands behind his
back.</p>

<p>"Let me put it this way, Mr.
Blacker. With the Earth's
population approaching the
three billion mark, you can
imagine that real estate is at
a greater premium than ever&mdash;yes,
even the remotest land
areas have gained in market
value. But let me ask you this.
If there were only a hundred
apples in the world, and you
owned all of them, what
would you do if you learned
that someone else had discovered
a fruitful orchard, which
contains ten million apples?"</p>

<p>"I'd go out of the apple
business."</p>

<p>"Precisely." Andrusco rocked
on his heels. "In a sense,
that's very much the problem
that Homelovers, Incorporated
may have to face in the
next generation."</p>

<p>"Somebody swiping your
apples?"</p>

<p>"In a way." The man
chuckled. "Yes, in a way." He
raised his arm slowly, and
pointed to the sky. "The
apples," he said, "are up
there."</p>

<p>"Huh?" Tom said.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Space, Mr. Blacker. Space
is opening its doors to us. Already,
the UN Space Commission
has launched some two
dozen manned vehicles into
the outer reaches. Already,
the satellite-building colony
on the moon is well under
way. The progress of our
space program has been accelerating
month by month.
The expert predictions have
been more and more optimistic
of late. In another ten,
twenty years, the solar system
will be beckoning the children
of Earth ..."</p>

<p>Tom said nothing for a
while. Then he cleared his
throat.</p>

<p>"Well ... I'm no expert on
these things. But maybe the
population could stand a little
more real estate, Mr. Andrusco.
In twenty years ..."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" The voice was
snappish. "The best authorities
say it isn't so. There's
plenty of room on Earth. But
if ever a mass exodus begins&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That doesn't seem possible,"
Tom said. "Does it? I
mean, only a handful of guys
have ever gone out there. A
drop in the bucket. I mean,
Mars and all that may be fun
to visit, but who'd want to
live there?"</p>

<p>Andrusco turned to him
slowly.</p>

<p>"The apples in the new
orchard may be sour, Mr.
Blacker. But if your livelihood
depended on your own
little stack of fruit&mdash;would
you be willing to sit by and
take the chance?"</p>

<p>Tom shrugged. "And is that
the public relations job? To
keep people out of space?"</p>

<p>"Put in its crudest form,
yes."</p>

<p>"A pretty tough job. You
know that guff about Man's
Pioneering Spirit."</p>

<p>"Yes. But we're worried
about the public spirit, Mr.
Blacker. If we can dampen
their ardor for space flight&mdash;only
delay it, mind you, for
another few years&mdash;we can
tighten our own lines of economic
defense. Do I make myself
clear?"</p>

<p>"Not completely."</p>

<p>"Will you take the job?"</p>

<p>"What does it pay?"</p>

<p>"Fifty thousand."</p>

<p>"Where do I sit?"</p>

<hr />

<p>By the afternoon, Tom
Blacker was ensconced in a
fair-sized office with vaguely
oriental furnishings and an
ankle-deep rug. Livia's pretty
ankles visited it first.</p>

<p>"Here's an outline I began
on the PR program," she told
him briskly, dropping a sheet
of paper on his desk. "I didn't
get very far with it. I'm sure
you can add a lot."</p>

<p>"Okay. I'll read it over this
afternoon." He tipped the
chair back. "How about dinner
tonight?"</p>

<p>"Sorry. Busy tonight. Maybe
later this week."</p>

<p>But it wasn't until Friday,
three days later, that he saw
Livia Cord again. He accomplished
that by calling her in
for a conference, spreading
his own typewritten notes on
the desk in front of him.</p>

<p>"Got some rough ideas
drafted on the program," he
told her. "The possibilities of
this thing are really unlimited.
Granted, of course, that
there's money in this picture."</p>

<p>"There's money all right,"
Livia said. "We don't have to
worry about that."</p>

<p>"Good. I've put down a list
of leading citizens that might
be enrolled as backers for anything
we might come up with,
people who have been outspoken
about the expense or danger
of space flight. We'll keep
it on file, and add to it as new
names crop up in the press.
Then here's a listing of categories
for us to develop subprograms
around. Religious,
economic, social, medical&mdash;Medical's
good. There's a heck
of a lot of scare-value in
stories about cosmic rays,
alien diseases, plagues, zero
gravity sickness, all that sort
of thing. Sterility is a good
gimmick; impotence is even
better."</p>

<hr />

<p>Livia smiled. "I know what
you mean."</p>

<p>"Mmm. Come to think of
it, we ought to set up a
special woman's-point-of-view
program, too. That'll be worth
plenty. Then there's the tax
question. We'll have to see
what we can set up in Washington,
some kind of anti-space
lobby. Good feature
story material here, too. You
know the stuff&mdash;one space
vessel equals the cost of two
hundred country hospitals."</p>

<p>"Sounds great."</p>

<p>"We'll have to plan on press
parties, special stuff for the
magazines and networks. I've
got a plan for some Hollywood
promotion to counteract
all this Destination Space
garbage they've been turning
out. And as for television&mdash;"</p>

<p>He talked on for another
hour, feeling mounting excitement
for the job he was doing.
Tom wasn't sure that he
liked the aims of Homelovers,
Incorporated, but the challenge
was enjoyable. Even at
dinner that night, in Livia's
snug apartment, he rattled on
about the PR program until
the girl began to yawn.</p>

<p>The bedroom was still
monochrome. Only Livia had
transformed it magically into
powder blue. Tom slept blissfully
until morning, and went
into the office that weekend
for sheer love of what he was
doing.</p>

<p>After less than a month,
his efforts started producing
results. On a crisp December
morning, he found the following
in his mail:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><i>"EARTH SONG"<br />
A Screenplay<br />

Duncan Devine</i></p>

<p><i>Roger Tenblade, a dashing
young rocket pilot in the UN
Air Force, yearns to join the
Space Expeditionary Force
now planning the first landing
and colonization of the planet
Mars. Despite the protest of
his lovely fianc&eacute;e, Diane, he
embarks upon the journey.
The trip is fraught with hazards,
and the ship is struck
by a meteor en route. Every
member of the crew is killed,
except Roger, who heroically
brings the vessel back to home
base. However, Roger is exposed
to large amounts of
cosmic radiation. When he is
so informed by the medical
authorities, he realizes that he
can never make Diane a normal
husband. So rather than
return to her and ruin her
life, he changes his identity
and disappears to South
America, where he takes a job
as a shuttle pilot for a third-class
airline.</i></p>

<p><i>Meanwhile, Diane marries
Harold Farnsworth, scion of
one of America's wealthiest
families ...</i></p></div>

<p>Tom Blacker chuckled, and
slipped the scenario back into
the envelope. He marked the
manuscript "O.K. for Production,"
and turned to the other
mail.</p>

<p>There was the prospectus
of a television series that
sounded interesting. He looked
it over carefully.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><i>"CAPTAIN TERRA"<br />

<p><i>Captain Terra, and his

<p class="center"><i>Program One, Act One</i></p>

<p><i>Bobby, Captain Terra's

enemy ...</i></p></div>

<p>Tom read the prospectus
through, and then dictated a
letter to its producers to call
for an appointment.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the mail
pile, he found an enthusiastic
letter from a theatrical producer
named Homer Bradshaw,
whom he had dealt with
briefly during his career at
Ostreich and Company.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Dear Tom,</i></p>

<p><i>This will be a real classy
show, with plenty of chorus
line and top gags. We plan to
kid the pants off this spaceman
business, until those
bright boys in the glass hats
cry uncle. I've already lined
up James Hocum for the top
banana, and Sylvia Crowe for
the female lead. You know
Sylvia, Tom; she'll make
space flight sound about as
chic as a debutante's ball on
the Staten Island Ferry. This
is the way to do the job, Tom&mdash;laugh
'em out of it.</i></p>

<p><i>If you're interested in a
piece of this, you can always
reach me at ...</i></p></div>

<p>He was about to call it a
day at five-thirty, when he got
a visiphone call from John
Andrusco. When he walked
into the immense office at the
other end of the floor, he saw
a glassy-eyed man standing at
Andrusco's desk, twirling his
hat with nervous fingers.</p>

<p>"Tom," Andrusco said
cheerfully, "want you to meet
somebody. This is Sergeant
Walt Spencer, formerly of the
UN Space Commission."</p>

<p>Tom shook the man's hand,
and he could feel it trembling
in his own.</p>

<p>"I called Walt in here specially,
thanks to that memo
you sent me, Tom. Great idea
of yours, about talking to
some of the boys who've actually
been in space. Walter
here's willing to cooperate a
hundred percent."</p>

<p>"That's fine," Tom said uneasily.</p>

<p>"Thought you two ought to
get together," Andrusco said,
reaching for his hat. "Think
he can help a lot, Tom. Talk
it over."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;suppose we have a
drink, Sergeant? That fit
your plans all right?"</p>

<p>"Suits me," the man said,
without emotion.</p>

<p>They went down in the elevator
together, and slid into a
red-leather booth in the Tuscany
Bar in the base of the
building. The sergeant ordered
a double Scotch, and
gulped it with the same respect
you give water.</p>

<p>"So you've been in space,"
Tom said, looking at him curiously.
"Must have been
quite an experience."</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;I take it you've left
the service."</p>

<p>"Yeah."</p>

<p>Tom frowned, and sipped
his martini. "How many trips
did you make, Sergeant?"</p>

<p>"Just one. Reconnaissance
Moon Flight Four. About six
years ago. You must have read
about it."</p>

<p>"Yes," Tom said. "Sorry."</p>

<p>The man shrugged. "Things
happen. Even on Earth,
things happen."</p>

<p>"Tell me something." Tom
leaned forward. "Is it true
about&mdash;" He paused, embarrassed.
"Well, you hear a lot
of stories. But I understand
some of the men on that
flight, the ones who got back
all right, had children. And&mdash;well,
you know how rumors
go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lies," Spencer said, without
rancor. "I've got two kids
myself. Both of 'em normal."</p>

<p>"Oh." Tom tried to hide his
disappointment behind the
cocktail glass. It would have
made great copy, if he could
have proved the truth of the
old rumor about two-headed
babies. But what <i>could</i> Sergeant
Spencer do for the PR
program? Andrusco must
have had something in mind.</p>

<hr />

<p>He asked him point-blank.</p>

<p>"It's like this," the man
said, his eyes distant. "Since
I quit the service, I haven't
been doin' so good. With
jobs, I mean. And Mr. Andrusco&mdash;he
said he'd give me
five thousand dollars if I'd&mdash;help
you people."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Andrusco describe
this help?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. He wants me to do
a story. About the kid my
wife had. The first kid."</p>

<p>"What about the first kid?"</p>

<p>"Well, she died, the first kid
did. In childbirth. It was
something that happens, you
know. My wife's a little woman;
the baby was smothered."</p>

<p>"I see. And what kind of
story do you want to tell?"</p>

<p>"It's not my idea." A hint
of stubbornness glimmered in
his dull eyes. "It's that Andrusco
guy's. He wants me to
tell how the baby was born a&mdash;mutant."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"He wants me to release a
story saying the baby was a
freak. The kid was born at
home, you see. The only other
person who saw her, besides
me and my wife, was this doctor
we had. And he died a
couple of years back."</p>

<p>Tom slumped in his chair.
This was pushing public relations
a little far.</p>

<p>"Well, I dunno," he said.
"If the baby was really normal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was normal, all right.
Only dead, that's all."</p>

<p>Tom stood up. "Okay, Sergeant
Spencer. Let me think
it over, and I'll give you a buzz
before the end of the week.
All right?"</p>

<p>"Anything you say, Chief."</p>

<hr />

<p>In the morning, Tom Blacker
went storming into John
Andrusco's plush office.</p>

<p>"Now look, Mr. Andrusco.
I don't mind slanting a story
a little far. But this Spencer
story of yours is nothing but
a hoax."</p>

<p>Andrusco looked hurt. "Did
he tell you that? How do you
like that nerve?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, that story's as genuine
as gold. We've known
about the freak birth for a
long time. Cosmic rays, you
know. Those men on that reconnaissance
flight really got
bombarded."</p>

<p>Tom wasn't sure of himself.
"You mean, it's true?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is! As a matter
of fact, we've got a photograph
of the dead baby,
right after it was delivered.
The doctor who attended Mrs.
Spencer took it without their
knowledge, as a medical
curiosity. He sold it to us several
years ago. We've never
used it before, because we
knew that the Spencers would
just deny it. Now that Walt's
willing to cooperate ..."</p>

<p>"Can I see the photo?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly." He opened
the top drawer and handed
a glossy print across the desk.
Tom looked at it, and winced.</p>

<p>"Scales!" he said.</p>

<p>"Like a fish," Andrusco
said sadly. "Pretty sad, isn't
it?" He looked out of the window
and sighed cavernously.
"It's a menacing world up
there...."</p>

<p>The rest of the day was
wasted. Tom Blacker's mind
wasn't functioning right.</p>

<p>He told Livia about it at
lunch.</p>

<p>Livia Cord continued eating,
chewing delicately on her
food without flexing a muscle
or wincing an eyebrow.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the Third of April, the
story of Sergeant Walter
Spencer's first-born monster
broke in newspapers, magazines,
and telecasts across the
country. It was a five-year-old
story, but it carried too
much significance for the
space-minded present to be
ignored.</p>

<p>Two days later, Sergeant
Spencer, 32, and his wife,
Laura, 30, were found dead
of asphyxiation in their new
home in Greenwich, Connecticut.
The cause of death was
listed as suicide.</p>

<p>Tom Blacker didn't hear the
news until a day after it happened.
He was in Washington,
setting up a series of
meetings with members of a
House group investigating
space flight expenditures.
When he returned by 'copter
that evening, he found Police
Commissioner Joe Stinson
waiting for him in Tom's own
favorite chair.</p>

<p>The square, heavy-jowled
face was strangely calm.</p>

<p>"Long time no see," he said
mildly. "You've been a busy
man lately, Mr. Blacker."</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Stinson. Won't
you come in?"</p>

<p>"I'm in," the commissioner
shrugged. "Landlord let me
wait here. It's chilly outside.
Do you want the preliminaries,
or should we have the
main bout?"</p>

<p>"It's about Spencer, isn't
it?" Tom built himself a long
drink. "I heard about it on the
'copter radio, flying in. Too
bad. He was a nice guy; I
never met his wife."</p>

<p>"But you knew him, right?
In fact, you and the sergeant
did a lot of business together?"</p>

<p>"Look, Mr. Stinson. You
know what kind of job I'm
trying to do. It's no secret.
Spencer's story happened to
gear in nicely with our public
relations effort. And that's
all."</p>

<p>"Maybe it is." The commissioner's
eyes hardened. "Only
some of us aren't satisfied.
Some of us are kinda restless
about the coroner's verdict."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You heard me. It's fishy,
you know? Nice young couple
buys a new house, then turns
on the gas. Leave behind a
couple of kids, too. Boys, nice
boys."</p>

<p>"I couldn't feel worse about
it," Tom said glumly. "In a
way, I can almost feel responsible ..."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I dunno. They were perfectly
willing to release that
story about their first-born.
But maybe when they actually
saw it in print, they couldn't
stand the spotlight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And that's your theory?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But I hope I'm wrong,
Mr. Stinson. For my own
sake."</p>

<p>The commissioner drew a
folded sheet of paper out of
his pocket.</p>

<p>"Let me read you something.
This hasn't been released
to the press, and maybe
it won't be. Interested?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"It's a letter. A letter that
was never mailed. It's addressed
to Tom Blacker, care
of Homelovers, Incorporated,
320 Fifth-Madison, New
York."</p>

<p>"What?" Tom reached for
it.</p>

<p>"Uh-uh. It was never mailed,
so it's not your property.
But I'll read it to you." He
slipped on a pair of bifocals.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Dear Mr. Blacker. I've been
trying to reach you all week,
but you've been out of town.
Laura and I have just seen
the first news story about our
baby, and we're just sick
about it. Why didn't you tell
us about that photograph you
were going to print? If we
had known about that, we
never would have consented to
doing what you wanted. My
wife never gave birth to that
damned thing, and I don't
care who knows it. I've called
Mr. Andrusco to tell him that
we don't want any part of this
business any more. I'd send
you back every penny of the
five thousand dollars, only
we've already spent half of
it. I'm going to call the newspapers
and tell them everything ...</i></p></div>

<p>The commissioner paused.
"It goes on for another half
page. But no use reading any
more. I'd like a reaction, Mr.
Blacker. Got one handy?"</p>

<p>Tom was on his feet.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!" His fist
thudded into his palm. "The
letter's a fake!"</p>

<p>"That's easy to prove, Mr.
Blacker."</p>

<p>"But the picture was genuine!
Don't you see that? Sure,
we paid Spencer something
for his cooperation. But the
picture was the real thing,
taken by his family doctor.
You've heard what the medical
authorities said about it."</p>

<p>Stinson said nothing. Then
he got up slowly and walked
to the door.</p>

<p>"Maybe so. But you're
missing the point I want to
make, Mr. Blacker. This letter
was dated the same day as
the Spencer suicides. Does it
sound to you like the kind of
thing a man would put in a
suicide note? Think it over."</p>

<p>Tom looked at the door the
commissioner closed behind
him.</p>

<p>"No," he said aloud. "It
doesn't."</p>

<hr />

<p>Tom didn't go to the Homelovers
building the next morning.
He proceeded directly to
the Lunt Theatre, where
Homer Bradshaw was putting
<i>Be It Ever So Humble</i> into rehearsal.</p>

<p>He was in no mood for the
theatre, but the appointment
had been made too long before.
When he came through
the doors of the theatre,
Homer leaped halfway up the
aisle to greet him, and pounded
his back like a long-lost
pal. Actually, he had met the
producer only twice before.</p>

<p>"Great to have you here,
Tom!" he said enthusiastically.
"Great! We've just been
putting things together. Got
some red-hot numbers we had
written specially for us. Wait
'til you hear 'em!" He waved
towards the two shirtsleeved
men hovering around the on-stage
piano. "You know Julie,
don't you? And Milt Steiner?
Great team! Great team!"</p>

<p>They took seats in the sixth
row while Homer raved about
the forthcoming production
that was going to cost Homelovers,
Incorporated some
hundred thousand dollars. A
dozen shapely girls in shorts
and leotards were kicking
their heels lackadaisically in
the background, and a stout
man with a wild checkered
suit was wandering around
the stage with an unlit cigar
in his hand, begging the
stagehands for a match.</p>

<p>"Hey, fellas!" Homer Bradshaw
called to the men at the
piano. "Run through that
<i>Gypsy</i> number for Mr. Blacker,
huh?"</p>

<p>They came to life like animated
dolls. The tallest of
the pair stepped in front of
the stage while the other
thumped the piano keys. The
tall one sang in a loud nasal
voice, with an abundance of
gestures.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"<i>Gypsy!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Gypsy!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Why do you have to be a gypsy?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Life could be so ipsy-pipsy</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Staying home and getting tipsy</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Safe on Earth with me!</i>"<br /></span>
</div>

<p>He swung into the second
chorus while Tom Blacker
kept his face from showing
his true opinion of the specialty
number. The next offering
didn't change his viewpoint.
It was a ballad. A
blonde girl in clinging black
shorts sang it feelingly.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"<i>There's a beautiful Earth tonight</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With a beautiful mellow light</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Shining on my spaceman in the moon.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Why did he leave me?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Only to grieve me?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Spaceman, come home to me soon ...</i>"<br /></span>
</div>

<p>"Did you like it? Did you
like it?" Homer Bradshaw
said eagerly.</p>

<p>"It'll do fine," Tom Blacker
said, with his teeth clenched.</p>

<hr />

<p>When he left the theatre,
Tom visiphoned the office to
tell Livia that he was taking
the rest of the day off. But he
found that Livia herself was
spending the day in her two-room
apartment downtown.
He hung up, and decided that
he had to talk to her about
Stinson's visit. He hopped a
cab, and gave him Livia's address.</p>

<p>John Andrusco answered
the door.</p>

<p>"Well! Thought you were
at the office, Tom?"</p>

<p>He found himself glaring at
the lean-jawed executive.
What was Andrusco doing
here?</p>

<p>"I've been over at the theatre,"
Tom explained. "Watching
that musical we're
spending all that dough on."
He stepped inside. "I might
say the same about you, Mr.
Andrusco."</p>

<p>"Me? Oh, I just came to
talk over some business with
Livia. Poor kid's not feeling
so hot, you know."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't." He dropped
his hat familiarly on the contour
couch, with almost too
much deliberation. "Livia in
bed?"</p>

<p>"No." The girl appeared at
the door of the bedroom,
wrapping a powder-blue negligee
around her. "What
brings you here, Tom?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I wanted to talk something
over with you. Now
that you're here, Mr. Andrusco,
we can <i>all</i> talk it
over."</p>

<p>"What's that?" Andrusco
made himself at home at the
bar.</p>

<p>"It's about Walt Spencer. I
had a visitor last night, the
police commissioner. He
showed me a letter that Spencer
had written just before he&mdash;before
he died. It was addressed
to me, only Spencer
had never mailed it."</p>

<p>Andrusco looked sharply at
the girl. "And what was in
this letter?"</p>

<p>"He was upset," Tom said.
"He wanted to back out of the
deal we made. Said the picture
was a phoney. But the
thing that's bothering the police
is the <i>tone</i> of the damned
letter. It just doesn't sound
like a man about to kill himself
and his wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that all?" Livia took the
drink from Andrusco's hand
and sipped at it. "I thought it
was something serious."</p>

<p>"It is serious!" Tom looked
sternly at her. "I want to
know something, Mr. Andrusco.
You told me that picture
was genuine. Now I want
you to tell me again."</p>

<p>The man smiled, with perfect
teeth. "How do you
mean, genuine? Is it a picture
of a genuine infant with
scales?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I assure you. In that respect,
the picture is absolutely
genuine."</p>

<p>Tom thought it over.</p>

<p>"Wait a while. Was the
story genuine, too?"</p>

<p>John Andrusco smiled. He
sat on the sofa, and rubbed
the palms of his hands over
his knees. Then he looked towards
Livia Cord and said:</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;I didn't think we
could hold out on our clever
Mr. Blacker as long as we
have. So we might as well enlist
his cooperation fully. Eh,
Livia?"</p>

<p>"I think so." The girl
smiled, her teeth sharp.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?"
Tom said.</p>

<p>"The infant," John Andrusco
answered slowly, "was
not Walter Spencer's child.
That, I'm afraid, was nothing
more than a little white lie."</p>

<p>Tom looked confused.</p>

<p>"Then what was it?"</p>

<p>Livia finished her drink.</p>

<p>"It was my child."</p>

<hr />

<p>The man and the woman,
whose grins now seemed
permanently affixed to their
faces, were forced to wait a
considerable amount of time
before Tom Blacker was both
ready and able to listen to
their explanation.</p>

<p>Livia did most of the talking.</p>

<p>"You'll probably be horrified
at all this," she said, with
a trace of amusement around
her red mouth. "Particularly
since you and I have been&mdash;"
She paused, and looked towards
Andrusco with a slight
lift of her shoulder. "Well,
you know. But you needn't
feel too squeamish, Tom. After
all, I was born and raised
on Earth. I am, you might say,
an honorary Earth woman."</p>

<p>Tom's eyes bulged at her.</p>

<p>"This civilization from
which my husband and I claim
ancestry is perhaps no older
than your own. Unfortunately,
we were not blessed with
a planetary situation as
agreeable as Earth's. Our sun
is far feebler, the orbital
paths of our moons act drastically
upon our waters, causing
generations of drought
and centuries of flood ..."</p>

<p>"What are you talking
about?" Tom said hoarsely.</p>

<p>"I speak of home," Livia
Cord said. And her eyes
gleamed.</p>

<p>"Antamunda is the name we
give it," John Andrusco said
cordially. "A world very much
like your own in size and atmosphere,
Mr. Blacker. But
tragically, a world whose usefulness
has been gradually
coming to an end. Our ancestors,
who were scientists of
much ability, foresaw this
some hundreds of years ago.
Since that time, they have
been seeking a solution to the
problem."</p>

<p>"I don't believe this!"</p>

<p>"We have," Livia said carefully,
"excellent evidence."</p>

<p>"Some five hundred years
ago," Andrusco continued,
"our people despatched an exploratory
space vessel. A
home-hunting force, seeking
to relocate the surviving members
of our race. It was a long,
trying odyssey, but it finally
culminated in the selection of
a new home. I needn't tell you
that the home is in your own
solar system."</p>

<p>Tom shot to his feet. "You
mean Earth? You mean you
want to take over here&mdash;"</p>

<p>Andrusco looked shocked.
"Certainly not! What a violent
thought, Mr. Blacker!"</p>

<p>"The planet you call Mars,"
Livia said coolly, "was the selected
destination. A planet
with only limited facilities for
the support of life. But a
planet even more like our own
dying world than Earth, Mr.
Blacker. So you needn't cry
havoc about alien invaders."
She laughed sharply.</p>

<p>"Then what are you doing
here?"</p>

<p>"Merely waiting," Andrusco
said. "We are the offspring
of the surviving
members of the expeditionary
force from Antamunda,
placed here on Earth as a vanguard
of the immigration that
will shortly take place to this
system. But your own world
is in no danger, Mr. Blacker.
That you must believe. Physically,
our people are not your
equals. Scientifically, we are
advanced in certain fields and
shamefully backwards in
others. Biologically&mdash;" He
frowned. "This is our greatest
weakness. To the Antamundans,
your breeding
capacity is nothing short of
grotesque." His handsome lip
curled. He enjoyed watching
Tom's reaction.</p>

<hr />

<p>Tom swallowed hard. "How
long have you been here?"</p>

<p>"Some four generations
have been born here. Our duty
has been merely to await the
arrival of our people. But in
the last fifty years, we found
ourselves faced with another
obligation. It was that obligation
which brought about the
formation of Homelovers, Incorporated."</p>

<p>"I don't understand."</p>

<p>"We had underestimated
the science of Earth. Our own
necessity drove us towards
the perfection of space flight.
Earth had no such urgency.
But now&mdash;" Livia looked
mournful. "Now we were
faced with the possibility that
Mars would soon be a colony
of your own planet, before our
people had a chance to make
it their rightful home. You
can see the consequences of
that. A conflict of interests, a
question of territorial rights.
Even the possibility of an interplanetary
war&mdash;"</p>

<p>"War!"</p>

<p>"A possibility greatly to be
abhorred," Andrusco said.
"And one we were sure we
could eliminate, if we could
merely <i>delay</i> the colonization
of Mars."</p>

<p>"Don't you see?" Livia said
earnestly. "If we could make
Mars our natural home, then
the people of Earth would
come to us as friendly visitors&mdash;or
invaders, whichever they
prefer. But if we arrived too
late&mdash; No, Tom. We feel that
it is imperative&mdash;to the peace
of <i>both</i> our worlds&mdash;that
Antamunda reach Mars first."</p>

<p>"Then it's a race!" Tom
was bewildered.</p>

<p>"You may call it that. But
a race we are determined to
win. And we <i>will</i> win!"</p>

<p>Tom thought of another
question.</p>

<p>"The infant," he said. "The
creature with scales ..."</p>

<p>"It was mine," the girl said
sadly. "Born to John and me
some ten years ago. Unfortunately,
it did not live. And
while your Earth eyes may
consider it a creature&mdash;" She
drew herself up proudly. "It
was a perfectly formed Antamundan
child."</p>

<p>Tom gaped at her.</p>

<p>"No," she said, answering
the question in his gaze. "You
are looking at us as we are.
We lose our scales after our
infancy, when our mouths are
formed ..."</p>

<p>After a while, Tom asked:</p>

<p>"And what about Spencer?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunate," the man
said. "His betrayal to the
press would have done us incalculable
harm. It was necessary
to do what we did."</p>

<p>"Then you did kill them?"</p>

<p>Livia turned her head aside.</p>

<p>"And you think I'll stand
for that?" Tom said.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," Andrusco
said. "But frankly&mdash;I don't
really know what you can do
about it. Except, of course, repeat
this explanation to the
authorities. You're free to do
that, Tom. Any time at all."
He smiled, slyly.</p>

<p>"You think they won't believe
me?"</p>

<p>Livia came over to Tom's
chair, and slithered one arm
around his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Why, Tom, darling. Are
you so sure that <i>you</i> believe
it?"</p>

<hr />

<p>He left the apartment some
ten minutes later, and took a
cab to 320 Fifth-Madison. It
was almost five o'clock, and
the steel-and-glass cylinder
was emptying rapidly of its
Homelovers employees. He
watched the stream of ordinary
people stepping off the
elevators: the young secretaries
with their fresh faces
and slim figures, laughing at
office anecdotes and sharing
intimate confidences about
office bachelors; the smooth-cheeked
young executives, in
their gray and blue suits,
gripping well-stocked brief
cases, and striding energetically
down the lobby, heading
for the commuter trains; the
paunchy, dignified men with
their gray temples and gleaming
spectacles, walking slowly
to the exits, quoting stock
prices and planning golf
dates.</p>

<p>The crowd eddied about
him like a battling current as
he made his way towards the
elevators, and their images
swam before his face in pink-and-white
blurs. And for one
terrible moment, in the thickest
vortex of the crowd, he
began to imagine that the
faces were melting before his
eyes, the mouths disappearing
into the flesh, and below the
white collars and black-knit
ties and starched pink
blouses appeared a shimmering
collection of ugly scales.</p>

<p>He shuddered, and stepped
into an empty car, punching
the button that shot him to
the executive floor of the
Homelovers Building.</p>

<p>In his office, he switched on
the visiphone and made contact
with a square-faced man
who frowned mightily when
he recognized his caller.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" Stinson
said.</p>

<p>"I have to see you," Tom
told him. "I learned something
this afternoon, about
Walt Spencer. I don't know
whether you'll believe it or
not, but I have to take that
chance. Will you talk to me?"</p>

<p>"All right. But we'll have
to make it down here."</p>

<p>"I'll be there in an hour. I
want to organize a few things
first. Then we can talk."</p>

<p>Tom switched off, and began
to empty his desk. He
found nothing in the official
communications of the Homelovers
that would substantiate
his story, but he continued to
gather what information he
could about the PR program.</p>

<p>He was just clicking the
locks on his brief case, when
a gray-haired woman with a
pencil thrust into her curls
popped her head in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Mr. Blacker?" she smiled.
"I'm Dora, Mr. Wright's secretary.
Mr. Wright wants to
know if you'll stop in to see
him."</p>

<p>"Wright?" Tom said blankly.</p>

<p>"The treasurer. His office is
just down the hall. He's very
anxious to see you, something
about the expense sheets you
turned in last week."</p>

<p>Tom frowned. "Why don't
I see him in the morning?"</p>

<p>"It won't take but a minute."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>He sighed, picked up the
brief case, and followed Dora
outside. She showed him the
door of an office some thirty
paces from his own, and he
entered without knocking.</p>

<p>A frail man, with a bald
head and a squiggly moustache,
stood up behind his
desk.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," he said nervously.
"I'm terribly sorry to do
this, Mr. Blacker. But I have
my instructions."</p>

<p>"Do what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," Mr. Wright said
again.</p>

<hr />

<p>He took the gun that was
lying in his out-box, and fired
it. His trembling hand sent
the bullet spanging into the
wooden frame of the door.
Tom dropped to the thick carpet,
and then scrambled to the
tall credenza set against the
right wall of the office. He
shoved it aside with his left
hand and ducked behind it.
The treasurer came out from
behind his desk, still muttering
to himself.</p>

<p>"Please," he said in anguish,
"this is very painful for
me!"</p>

<p>He fired the gun again, and
the bullet tore a white hole in
the wall above Tom's head.</p>

<p>"Don't be so difficult," the
little man pleaded. "Sooner or
later&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Tom insisted upon being
difficult. His fingers
closed around a loose volume
of New York State Tax Laws,
and jiggled it in readiness.
When the little treasurer
came closer, he sprung from
hiding and hurled the book.
It slammed against Wright's
side, and surprised him
enough to send the arm
holding the weapon into the
air. That was the advantage
Tom wanted. He leaped in a
low-flying tackle, and brought
Wright to the carpet. Then he
was on top of the little man,
grappling for the gun. Tom
fought hard to get the gun.</p>

<p>He got it, but not before it
was fired again.</p>

<p>Tom looked down at the
widening stain that was marring
the smooth texture of the
carpet and was horrified. He
bent down over the frail figure,
lifting the bald head in
his hands.</p>

<p>"Mr. Wright!"</p>

<p>The treasurer groaned.
"Sorry," he said. "Instructions,
Mr. Blacker ..."</p>

<p>"From whom? Andrusco?"</p>

<p>"Yes ... Your message reported
from switchboard ...
had orders ..."</p>

<p>"Is it true?" Tom said
frantically. "About Antamunda?
Is the story true?"</p>

<p>The little man nodded.
Then he lifted one hand feebly
towards the desk. "Gary,"
he said. "Tell Gary ..."</p>

<p>Tom looked in the direction
of the gesture, and saw the
back of a framed photograph.</p>

<p>When he turned to the
treasurer again, the thin lips
had stopped moving.</p>

<p>He lowered the body to the
floor and went to the desk.
The photo was that of a young
man with stiff-bristled blond
hair and a rugged smile. The
inscription read:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<i>To Pop, with deep affection,
Gary.</i>"</p></div>

<p>Tom shook his head, wonderingly.
Were these creatures
so very different?</p>

<hr />

<p>When Tom stepped out on
Fifth-Madison some ten minutes
later, it was just in time
to watch a police vehicle
draw up to the entrance of
320. Sensing danger, he stepped
into the shade of the Tuscany
Bar awning, and
watched the uniformed men
pound their way down the
marbled lobby floor towards
the elevators. He thought fast,
and decided that the arrival
of the police was connected
with the shooting in Wright's
office.</p>

<p>The question was&mdash;who
were they after?</p>

<p>He walked into the Tuscany,
and headed for the bank
of visiphone booths. He
dialed the police commissioner,
but ducked out of the path
of the visiphone eye.</p>

<p>Stinson growled at the
blank screen. "Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Never mind," Tom said,
muffling his voice. "But if you
want the killers of Walt
Spencer and his wife, pick up
John Andrusco and a gal
named Livia Cord."</p>

<p>"Okay, Blacker," Stinson
thundered. "I knew you'd be
calling in."</p>

<p>Tom swore, and showed
himself. "Listen, I'm telling
you the truth. They told me
the whole story. Then they
tried to have me killed."</p>

<p>"Is that so? And I suppose
the assassin was a guy named
Wright?"</p>

<p>"Yes!"</p>

<p>"Okay, wise guy. We're on
to you. You've been pocketing
some of that Homelovers
dough, and the treasurer
found you out. Isn't that the
story?"</p>

<p>"No! Wright's one of
<i>them</i>."</p>

<p>"Sure, pal. Whatever you
say. Only stay right where
you are so you can do your
explaining proper."</p>

<p>Tom tightened his lips.
"Uh-huh. I don't like the
sound of things. I'll see you
later, Mr. Stinson."</p>

<p>"Blacker!"</p>

<p>Tom switched off.</p>

<p>By the time he was settled
behind the red neck of a cab-driver,
Tom was wiping a
dripping film of sweat from
his forehead. He couldn't return
to his apartment; there
was bound to be a stake-out.
He couldn't go to Livia's; that
would be walking right into
danger. And he couldn't go to
Stinson, without risking a
murder charge.</p>

<p>He leaned forward.</p>

<p>"Driver&mdash;make that the LaGuardia
Heliport."</p>

<p>However efficient Stinson's
operations might have been,
their tentacles hadn't reached
the 'copter-rental station at
the heliport. Tom signed out
a speedy vessel under an assumed
name, and taxied it
down the runway. Then he
pointed the nose west, and
radioed ahead to his destination
at Washington, D. C.</p>

<hr />

<p>Colonel Grady Mordigan
had the thoughtful air of a
scholar and the body of a college
wrestler. When Tom
Blacker's name was announced
to him, his mouth turned
down grimly. He was commanding
officer of the Space
Flight Commission of the UN
Air Force, and he had good
reason to frown at the sound
of the PR man's name.</p>

<p>But he invited him into his
office.</p>

<p>"So you're Tom Blacker,"
he said, pinching his jaw.
"I've heard a lot about you,
Mr. Blacker."</p>

<p>"I'm sure," Tom said.
"Only I want to tell you this,
Colonel. I've broken my connection
with Homelovers. I'm
on your side now."</p>

<p>"Side? There are no sides
in this issue, Mr. Blacker. As
far as I'm concerned, Homelovers
is nothing but a flea on
the lip of a lion. A damned
annoying flea, maybe&mdash;but
nothing more than that. Now
what do you want?"</p>

<p>"I have to talk to you about
something. Something I just
found out. Will you listen to
me?"</p>

<p>The colonel leaned back,
looking at his watch.</p>

<p>"Five minutes," he snapped.</p>

<hr />

<p>Tom talked for fifteen.
Mordigan didn't call a halt
until he was finished, listening
without a change of expression.
When Tom ran out
of words, he merely tapped
his fingers on the desk.</p>

<p>"And that's your whole
story?" he said gently.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I know it's a wild
one. That's one of the things
they're counting on. It's just
wild enough to get me put
into a laughing academy,
where I can't do them any
mischief. But I had to take
that chance, Colonel."</p>

<p>"I see. And this&mdash;man you
killed. What's happening
about that?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," Tom said.
"The way I figure it, Andrusco
and the girl have told the
police that I was embezzling
money from the firm&mdash;that I
killed the treasurer for my
own protection. But it's not
true! He's one of <i>them</i>&mdash;one
of those creatures&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you have no real
proof?"</p>

<p>Tom's back stiffened. "No,"
he said grimly. "If I had
proof, I'd have gone to the police.
But I came here instead.
Now you can tell me if I did
the right thing."</p>

<p>Mordigan grimaced. "I
don't know, damn it! I don't
have any love for the Homelovers.
To me, they've always
been a bunch of greedy businessmen,
intent on salvaging
their franchises at any expense.
But it's not easy to
think of them as a bunch
of&mdash;" His mouth twisted.
"Loathsome aliens ..."</p>

<p>"Maybe not so loathsome,"
Tom said miserably. "I just
don't know. Maybe their cause
is as just to them as ours is to
us. But they're determined to
reach Mars before we do&mdash;before
you do! And they'll do
anything to make sure&mdash;"</p>

<p>The colonel stood up. "But
I'm afraid that question is
academic, Mr. Blacker. Because
if our calculations are
right, an Earth vessel will be
on the planet Mars within the
next thirty-six hours."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"No announcement has
been made. But a Mars-bound
ship was launched almost a
month ago, containing seven
members of the space commission.
Our last radio contact
with Captain Wright
leads us to expect&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Who?</i>" Tom was on his
feet.</p>

<p>"Captain Gary Wright, the
commander of the ship." His
brow knitted. "Why? Do you
know him?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure," Tom said
weakly. "But if he's the same
man&mdash;then that flight's in
danger."</p>

<p>"What are you talking
about?"</p>

<hr />

<p>Tom concluded his story
about the death of the Homelovers
treasurer, down to the
last detail of the framed photograph
on Wright's desk.
The tale brought Colonel
Mordigan into immediate action.
He buzzed for his orderly,
and in another minute,
was fumbling through a folder
marked Classified.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said numbly. "It's
the same man. Father's named
Benjamin Wright, and he's
vice-president and treasurer
of Homelovers, Incorporated.
I never connected the two ..."
He looked up, his eyes heavy.
"If your story is true, Mr.
Blacker, then Captain Wright
is one of these so-called Antamundans.
And if their mission
is what you say it is&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tom clenched his fists on
the blotter. "Please, sir! Let
me stay here until the flight
is concluded. After that, you
can do what you like."</p>

<p>"All right," Mordigan said
wearily. "I'll fix you up with
something in the officer's
quarters. But I'm sure you're
wrong, Mr. Blacker. You
<i>have</i> to be."</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours later,
radio contact with the Mars
expeditionary ship ceased abruptly.</p>

<p>From Mt. Wilson observatory,
a hurried message
arrived, reporting a small,
brief nova in the orbital vicinity
of the planet Mars.</p>

<p>Tom Blacker, dozing fitfully
on a cot in the quarters
of a grumpy Lieutenant-Colonel,
was awakened suddenly,
and summoned to the office of
Colonel Grady Mordigan.</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Blacker,"
the colonel said stiffly. "I'm
willing to help. Just tell me
what you want me to do."</p>

<hr />

<p>The receptionist smiled
icily at Tom, and then the
smile vanished like a Martian
polar cap.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;Mr. Blacker!"</p>

<p>"Hi, Stella," he grinned.
"Mr. Andrusco in his office?"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know. Suppose
I give him a ring&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped the hand that
was reaching for the telephone.
"No need of that. I
think I'll just surprise him.
After all, it's been some time."</p>

<p>He turned the knob of
John Andrusco's door slowly.</p>

<p>Livia was with him. When
he entered, they both stood up
hastily, their eyes wide and
their mouths unhinged.</p>

<p>Livia reacted first. She
cried out his name, and then
sat down heavily, as if the
words had been a physical
force.</p>

<p>"Hi, Livia," Tom said casually.
"Good to see you again,
Mr. Andrusco. Sorry that I
haven't been around&mdash;but
things have been pretty hectic
for me lately."</p>

<p>"How did you get here?"
Andrusco's voice was choked.</p>

<p>"I've been here all weekend,
if you want to know."
Tom seated himself blithely.
"As a matter of fact, the
Homelovers Building has had
quite a lot of visitors this
weekend."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"You know the staff of
cleaning personnel that invades
this place every Saturday?
Well, there were some
changes made this particular
weekend. I'm sure you'll be
interested in hearing about
them."</p>

<p>Livia said: "Shall I call the
police, John?"</p>

<p>"The police were represented,"
Tom said. "Don't worry
about that. In fact, the top
technicians from three government
agencies were doing
the housework around here
this weekend, Mr. Andrusco.
They probably didn't get the
building much cleaner&mdash;but
they swept up a lot of other
things. Yes, they certainly uncovered
other things."</p>

<hr />

<p>Andrusco walked over to
Livia, and touched her shoulder
in a comforting gesture.
The sight of them made Tom
scowl.</p>

<p>"All right!" he said roughly.
"I'm not blaming you for
what you're doing. But things
were getting out of hand, Mr.
Andrusco. That's why we had
to put a stop to it."</p>

<p>"And have you?" Andrusco
asked politely.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so. It was quite
a shock, let me tell you. We
didn't know what to expect
when we dissected this building
of yours. But the last
thing we expected to find was&mdash;a
spaceship."</p>

<p>Andrusco smiled. "It was
cleverly done. You'll have to
admit that."</p>

<p>"I do," Tom said fervently.
"You've got those space flight
experts absolutely insane with
curiosity. They'll want to hear
the whole story. Will you give
it to them?"</p>

<p>The man shrugged. "It
doesn't matter, I suppose. I
presume the engines have
been dismantled?"</p>

<p>"Made inoperable, yes. It
would have been a great
trick, if you could have done
it."</p>

<p>Livia spoke sadly. "It was
the only thing we could have
done. There's no place on this
Earth where we could have
erected a spaceship without
being observed. So we created
this building. In time, we
would have perfected the
mechanism and left this silly
planet of yours."</p>

<p>"That's what I don't understand,"
Tom said. "What
about Antamunda&mdash;and the
survivors&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's no longer an Antamunda,"
John Andrusco
said hollowly. "The story we
told you was true in its
essence, but not, I'm afraid
complete. You see, the exodus
that took place five hundred
years ago was a total exodus.
The entire population of our
world&mdash;a handful, a pitiful
ragged thousand&mdash;left Antamunda
for this planet. We
thought to make it our new
home, for all eternity. But in
time, we learned that we had
emigrated to an extinction
just as certain."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"This world is cursed to us,
Mr. Blacker. I can't tell you
why. We breed slowly, infrequently&mdash;you
might even say,
thoughtfully. And on your
planet, but one child in a
thousand has survived the
rigors of childbirth on
Earth." He looked at Livia,
and the woman lowered her
eyes in remembered sorrow.</p>

<p>"That's why we had to
leave," Andrusco said. "To
repopulate elsewhere. We
chose the planet Mars, and
we were determined to make
it our home before your world
claimed it. Our scientists and
technicians have worked on
nothing else but this flight
since the beginning of the last
century. This building&mdash;this
vessel&mdash;was the culmination
of our plans. In another few
years, we would have been
ready. The dream would have
been realized."</p>

<hr />

<p>Tom walked to the window
of the office, and looked out at
a bank of swift-moving clouds
drifting past the spire of the
Homelovers Building.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that's the saddest
part," he said. "The
atomic engines in the basement
have been examined,
Mr. Andrusco. The best opinions
say that they're pitifully
inadequate. The men who
studied them say that you
would never have made the
journey in safety."</p>

<p>"That can't be true! In
time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In time, perhaps. But
since your landing here, your
scientists have forgotten a
great deal about space flight.
I'm afraid you would have
never reached that Promised
Land ..."</p>

<p>Andrusco said: "Then we
must die ..."</p>

<p>"No!" Tom said.</p>

<p>Livia looked at him.</p>

<p>"I said no!" he repeated.
"The Antamundans can live.
Don't you see that?"</p>

<p>"No," Andrusco said, shaking
his head. "On Earth, we
shall die. If Mars is closed to
us ..."</p>

<p>"Can't you see? If Mars
can be opened for Earth, then
it can be opened for you, too.
For all Antamundans! Your
people can make the journey,
too, once space has been
cleared for Earth ships. You
can still have your new
home!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps," Livia said
dreamily. "Perhaps that is the
only way. But by then, Tom,
it will be already too late.
There has been no living child
born to us in the last ten
years. By the time the Earth
people reach Mars and establish
regular passageway&mdash;we
will be too old to keep the
race alive."</p>

<hr />

<p>"Then let's speed it up!" he
said. "Let's make <i>sure</i> that
the space lanes open! Let's do
everything to make Space the
most important project on
Earth!"</p>

<p>"But how?" Andrusco said,
bewildered.</p>

<p>Tom went to the visiphone.</p>

<p>"Get me the Lunt Theatre!"
he snapped.</p>

<p>Homer Bradshaw's face appeared.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bradshaw?"</p>

<p>"Hi, Tom! How's the boy?"</p>

<p>"Great, Homer, great. Only
listen. I got a new angle for
you. We're gonna doctor up
that show of yours before the
opening. Don't worry about
the dough&mdash; Homelovers will
take care of it with pleasure."</p>

<p>"Sure, Tom! Anything you
say!"</p>

<p>"Then take this down. The
first thing we're changing is
the title. From now on it's
<i>Mars Or Bust</i> ..."</p>
